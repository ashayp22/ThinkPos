# ThinkPos - Creating a positive change in the world through the power of quotes.

### Project Details

With all the negativity being spread around in the online world, we wanted to find a solution that changes this narrative. So, we decided to create a platform where people can spread positivity by submitting personal quotes on different topics.

Whether it is an educational, comedic, or even a interesting quote, you never know who may benefit from reading these unique statements from people coming from all walks of life. We want to provide a safe space for people to share their opinions and ideas on certain subjects without being criticized for the belief that they have. Our goal for this project is to create a website that will leave a lasting impact on society.

ThinkPos provides people with a platform to spread positivity through personal quotes. We provide a user-friendly platform where unique individuals can share their beliefs, ideas, and opinions on all kinds of issues that are prevalent in our lives today.
